Run Book outline
========

***should the run book deal with the SOS establishing the risk
limit, or any of their pre-audit responsibilities like the selection
of which races to audit? (SS says, yes, briefly, in the context of 
what needs to be entered into the tool.)

Brief introduction to RLAs in non-technical, human friendly language.
At the county level, something along the lines of "This tool is going
to help you cross reference votes recorded on paper ballots with how 
the computers read those ballots, to determine whether the computers
did their job accurately…” Try to put their minds at ease about the
process. :)

Terms and process for the RLA are defined and prescribed in Rule 25.
*** citation for Rule 25.

***should the run book cover the mechanics of storing ballots and the
other physical aspects of the RLA process which are not ‘in’ the RLA
tool/system?

Basic overview: Screenshots of the dashboard/tool, ordered in the sequence
they will be encountered, with brief, clear instructions describing what
is expected of the user(s) at each step, starting with the login screen
and proceeding through the completion of the audit, or determination that
a full hand count is required. First SOS, then County, then Public.

For County Administrators
========

The RLA Tool is designed for comparison audits, which require a voting
system capable of exporting CVR files. Counties whose voting systems do not
export CVR files can use the RLA Tool to upload ballot manifests.

For the 2017 Colorado implementation, the full functionality of the RLA Tool requires exports from the 
Dominion System ???.

For County Audit Boards
========

Logging In

The Audit Board does not log directly into the RLA Tool with
computer system usernames and passwords. However, whenever 
the Audit Board begins to interact with the RLA Tool, either 
at the beginning of an audit round or after taking a break, 
the Audit Board must sign in.

descriptions of all fields and/or information/updates.

Detailed description with associated screenshot of the County dashboard
with instructions about the process of uploading ballot manifests and
CVRs, and associated hash functions.

***should the run book cover the preparation/creation of these artifacts
they’ll be uploading?

Description of the process of generating the random seed, perhaps with a
photograph of what the process will look like with folks looking on.

***Will the risk limit be auto populated to the counties’ dashboards, or
will they be instructed to enter it themselves?

***should more detailed instructions/descriptions for the retrieving of
ballots, and the rules about interpretation of ballot marks, be included
in the run book?

I don't think (but will happily stand corrected) the run book needs to contain
the 'why' -- only the 'how' and where/when/etc. of the process as experienced
by the users/auditors. Each screenshot should have an associated index
describing key features/fields/etc. which can be numerically identified.
Instructions will instruct auditors to loop back if another round (or rounds)
of ballots need to be inspected.

Besides a printed document with screenshots and instructions, we could also
offer to create a tutorial video (videos, probably) where we film people using
the tool/dashboards, with narration describing what they are doing, and what comes
next depending on what’s happening.
