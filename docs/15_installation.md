Running the latest development version
--------------
For testing purposes, you can run the latest versions of the client and server directly from a clone of the [git repository](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ColoradoRLA).

For the server, follow the directions in [`server/README-ECLIPSE`](../server/README-ECLIPSE) to install Eclipse, and use Eclipse's Run menu.

To test the client in a standalone manner (rather than from the server), you'll need to get [Node.js and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Next, run:

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in a supported web browser.
