# Colorado Risk Limiting Audit 
# User Manual

This User Manual provides an overview of the components that comprise 
the Colorado Department of State’s (CDOS) Risk Limiting Audit Tool (RLA Tool). 
It contains annotated screenshots with detailed descriptions of what is 
contained on every page users will experience. It also contains a glossary 
of relevant terms. This RLA Tool represents the cutting edge in efforts to 
provide verifiable evidence that election results are accurate, and November 
2017 is the first time any state or jurisdiction has implemented them on a 
widescale basis.

## Basic Structure of Risk Limiting Audits

Once the Secretary of State establishes a risk limit and selects contests to 
be audited, counties will then use the RLA Tool to upload ballot manifests, 
cast vote records (CVRs), and summary results to a central server. The RLA 
Tool will use this data to determine the initial set of ballots to be checked 
for each contest based on the risk limit and the margins of victory in the 
contests to be audited. The RLA Tool will report this information to each 
county, where the Audit Board, consisting of representatives of different 
political parties, will retrieve the appropriate ballots and record their 
interpretations of voter intent in the RLA Tool. If there are too many 
mismatches between the Audit Board’s interpretations and the choices 
reported by the vote-tallying system, additional ballots may need to be 
randomly selected until either the risk limit is satisfied or a complete 
hand count is conducted. Complete audit results are exported from the RLA 
Tool for import to a Public Audit Center hosted on the official CDOS website.

## RLA Tool

The RLA Tool facilitates running a risk limiting audit across all counties 
in Colorado simultaneously. The RLA Tool has two dashboards. One dashboard 
serves CDOS, and the other serves the Counties. Both the CDOS and County 
dashboards require authentication to login. The RLA Tool also provides 
information to be used for a Public Audit Center, but does not contain it.
