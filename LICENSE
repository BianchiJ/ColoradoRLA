There are ongoing discussions with the Colorado Department of State
about which Open Source license is most appropriate for this system.

They have agreed to license it under a variant of the GPLv3, but the
final decision about which variant it will be licensed under is still
under discussion.

In particular, should it be licensed under
[AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), or
[GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)? Please see the
FSF document, ["Why the Affero
GPL"](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.en.html), for a
relevant discussion.

If you, the reader, have input on this decision, please add a comment
to Issue #315.

Thus, as of now, this system is not licensed for any use whatsoever
beyond its owner, the Colorado Department of State.
